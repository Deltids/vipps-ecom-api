This are the steps after you have received onboarding-email from vipps. You should have received proper credentials with username on email and password on the admin-phonenumber. Use those credentials to log into Vipps Developer Portal in either test or production.

We start with the typical Sign-in screen.

You type in your username and password here.
Now remember that there's a difference in both production and test when it comes to Vipps Developer Portal.

- Make shure that you are also logged out of other 365-accounts
- Make shure you are in incognito-modus in either Google Chrome or Windows Edge
- Make shure you are using the correct url. Remember https://apitest-portal.vipps.no/ for test, and https://api-portal.vipps.no/ for production.

After an successfull log-in you will see the admin-name up in the right corner of the screen. In the left corner you have several tabs.
The **"Manage User"** - gives you the possibility to add users.

The next tab **"Products"** shows you the API's you current have. As you see from the picture below you can have several products and the possibility to test them out in Vipps Developer Portal.

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title") Products

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title") Test the Api(s)

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title") Try it

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title") request payment

Now you probably wonder where you should get the API keys. Well, if you check out the tab "Applications" and click on the unit with the number-identificator that fits your salesunit, then you will find both client_id and client_secret.

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title") keys Applications

Under the tab "register application" it should say(marked in red):
'All existing products have been subscribed'
