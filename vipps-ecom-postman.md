## Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a common tool for working with REST APIs.
We offer a [Postman Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collection) to make development easier.
See the [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/) for more information about using Postman.
