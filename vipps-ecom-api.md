# Initiate

Vipps eCommerce API offers 2 types of payments:
1. Regular eCommerce payments
2. Express checkout payments

## Regular eCommerce payments

When you initiate a payment it will be reserved until you capture it.
Vipps supports both _reserve capture_ and _direct capture_.

_Reserve capture_ is the default. When you initiate a payment it will be reserved until you capture it.

When _direct capture_ is activated, all payment reservations will instantly be captured.
This is intended for situations where the product or service is immediately provided to the customer, e.g. digital services.

According to Norwegian regulations you should _not_ capture a payment until the product or service is provided to the customer.
For more information, please see the Consumer Authority's
[Guidelines for the standard sales conditions for consumer purchases of goods over the internet](https://www.forbrukertilsynet.no/english/guidelines/guidelines-the-standard-sales-conditions-consumer-purchases-of-goods-the-internet).

Merchants do not choose between _reserve capture_ and _direct capture_ themselves,
the type of capture is configured by Vipps after the additional compliance checks have been completed.


## Express checkout payments

Express checkout is an solution for letting the user automatically share their vipps profile address information with merchant and choose a shipping option.

To perform an express checkout, the merchant needs to send `"paymentType": "eComm Express Payment"` as part of initiate payment, and support the
`shippingDetails` and `consent` endpoints.

These are payments related to Vipps Hurtigkasse, where Vipps reduces the typical purchase process for the customer to
a few simple steps:

1. The user clicks on the "Vipps Hurtigkasse" button.
2. The user consents to sharing address information.
3. The user confirms the amount, delivery address and delivery method in the Vipps app.

The shipping methods presented to the user is provided by the merchant through the `shippingDetails` endpoint.

Vipps complies with GDPR, and requires the user's consent before any information
is shared with the merchant. The merchant must provide a URL (`consentRemovalPrefix`)
that Vipps can call to delete the data. The Vipps app allows the user to later remove this consent
(Via the profile-security-"access to your information"-"companies that remember you" screen).

## Initiate payment flow: Phone and browser

The Vipps landing page will detect if the Vipps native app is installed on the phone.
If the Vipps app is installed, it is automatically opened.

#### Vipps installed

1. Vipps is invoked.
2. The user accepts or rejects the payment request in Vipps.
3. Once payment process is completed, Vipps redirects to the `fallBack` URL that merchant provided earlier (see above).

#### Vipps not installed

1. The user is prompted for the mobile number on the Vipps landing page.
2. Vipps sends a push notification. The landing page is not closed in this case.
3. The user accepts or rejects the payment in Vipps.
4. Once payment process is completed, Vipps redirects to the `fallBack` URL that the merchant provided earlier.

### Desktop browser initiated payments

1. The landing page will be opened in the desktop browser.
2. The landing page will prompt for user’s mobile number.
3. Vipps sends a push notification to corresponding Vipps profile, if it exists.
   The landing page is not closed in this case.
4. The Vipps user accepts or rejects the payment request.
5. Once payment process is completed, the landing page will redirect to the
   `fallBack` URL that merchant provided earlier (see above).

#### Payments initiated in an app

Merchants can signal that the request is coming from their native app by passing
the `isApp:true` parameter. In this case, the Vipps backend returns an URL that
works as a native app deeplink to the Vipps app (eg. with a `vipps://` scheme)

The landing page is not involved in this case, since the merchant app is
expected to use the `vipps://` URL to deeplink straight to the native Vipps app.

1. Merchant initiates the payment with `isApp:true` parameter.
2. Vipps returns a `deeplink` URL as response to initiate payment.
3. The merchant uses the URL to invoke the Vipps app.
4. The Vipps user accepts or rejects the payment request.
5. Once payment process is completed, Vipps app redirects to the `fallBack` URL

## Initiate payment flow: API calls

Initiate payment is used to create a new payment order in Vipps:

[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)

**Initiate request headers example:**
```json
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer jfewioIJffruJIfewiyYUdweiLMfnewUQiwmdcLnfewjNj <snip>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": "12345678901234567890123456789012"
}
```

A request is authorized by the `Authorization` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` included in the
HTTP headers.
* `Authorization`: The word Bearer followed by the token from a Access Token request.
* `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`: Subscription key for the eCommerce Product.

**Initiate request body example:**

A minimal example:

```json
{
  "customerInfo": {
  },
  "merchantInfo": {
    "merchantSerialNumber": "123456",
    "callbackPrefix":"https://example.com/vipps/callbacks-for-payment-update",
    "fallBack": "https://example.com/vipps/fallback-result-page/order123abc"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "orderId": "order123abc",
    "amount": 20000,
    "transactionText": "One pair of Vipps socks"
  }
}
```

An express payment example with more parameters provided:

```json
{
  "customerInfo": {
    "mobileNumber": "48059528"
  },
  "merchantInfo": {
    "authToken": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <snip>",
    "callbackPrefix": "https://example.com/vipps/callbacks-for-payment-update",
    "consentRemovalPrefix": "https://example.com/vipps/consents/",
    "fallBack": "https://example.com/vipps/fallback-result-page/order123abc",
    "isApp": false,
    "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
    "shippingDetailsPrefix": "https://example.com/vipps/shipping/",
    "paymentType": "eComm Express Payment",
    "staticShippingDetails": [
        {
            "isDefault": "N",
            "priority": 1,
            "shippingCost": 30.0,
            "shippingMethod": "Walking",
            "shippingMethodId": "123abc"
        },
        {
            "isDefault": "Y",
            "priority": 2,
            "shippingCost": 30.0,
            "shippingMethod": "Running",
            "shippingMethodId": "321abc"
        }
    ]
  },
  "transaction": {
    "amount": 20000,
    "orderId": "order123abc",
    "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
    "transactionText": "One pair of Vipps socks"
  }
}
```

## Payment identification

A payment is uniquely identified by the combination of `merchantSerialNumber`
and `orderId`:
* `merchantSerialNumber`: The merchant's Vipps id.
* `orderId`: Must be unique for the `merchantSerialNumber`.

To initiate an express checkout payment the payment initiation call must include
the `"paymentType":"eComm Express Payment"` parameter. If this parameter is not
passed, the payment type will default to regular payment.

To add authentication to the callbacks made by Vipps the merchant may provide
an `authToken`. This token will then be returned as a `Authorization` header
in the callback and shipping details requests made by Vipps for that order.

Once successfully initiated, a response with a redirect URL is returned.

Please note that Vipps only makes _one_ request for the callback and shipping
details endpoints. There is no retry functionality, so the merchant's
server must be able to respond.

## orderId recommendations

A `orderId` must be unique for the MSN (Merchant Serial Number, the id of
the sale unit). The `orderId` does not need to be globally unique, so several
MSNs may use the same `orderId`, as long as it is unique for each sale unit.

While the minimum length for `orderId` is 1, we recommend
using at least 6 characters, and a combination of numbers and characters.

The maximum length of an `orderId` is 30 alphanumeric characters:
a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '-'.

Leading zeros should be avoided, as some applications (like Excel)
tend to remove them, and this may cause misunderstandings.

We _strongly_ recommend to use `orderId` format that makes it easy to
search for them in logs. This means that `abc-123-def-456` is a better
format than `123456`.

With multiple sale units, prefixing the `orderId` with the MSN
for each sale unit is recommended: If the MSN is `654321`, the
`orderId`s could start at `654321-0000-0000-0001` and increment by 1
for each order, or some similar, unique and readable pattern.


## URL Validation

All URLs in Vipps eCommerce API are validated with the
[Apache Commons UrlValidator](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/routines/UrlValidator.html).

If `isApp` is true, the `fallBack` is not validated with Apache Commons UrlValidator,
as the app-switch URL may be something like `vipps://`, which is not a valid URL.

The endpoints required by Vipps must be publicly available.

URLs that start with `https://localhost` will be rejected. If you want to use localhost as fallback, please use `http://127.0.0.1`.

Here is a simple Java class suitable for testing URLs,
using the dummy URL `https://example.com/vipps/fallback-result-page/order123abc`:

```java
import org.apache.commons.validator.routines.UrlValidator;

public class UrlValidate {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  UrlValidator urlValidator = new UrlValidator();

  if (urlValidator.isValid("https://example.com/vipps/fallback-result-page/order123abc")) {
   System.out.println("URL is valid");
  } else {
   System.out.println("URL is invalid");
  }
 }
}
```


## Callbacks

Callbacks allow Vipps to send the payment order details to the merchant.
During regular eCommerce payment, order and transaction details will be shared.
During express checkout payment it will provide user details and shipping
details addition to the order and transaction details.

This call will be performed once during a payment process, when the
payment is successful, failed, rejected or timed out. If the communication
is broken during the process for some reason, and Vipps is not able to
execute callback, then callback will not be retried. In other words,
if the merchant doesn’t receive any confirmation on payment request
call within callback timeframe, merchant should call
[GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)
to get the status of the payment.

The callback body received from Vipps will depend on whether the payment
type is set to `"eComm Express Payment"` or `"eComm Regular Payment"`.

If `authToken` was used in the initiate payment request these requests will have a `Authorization` header. These headers will have the same value as the one provided in `authToken`.

API details: [`POST:[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST)


### Vipps callback servers

The callbacks from Vipps are made from the servers described in
[Vipps request servers](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#vipps-request-servers).

Please make sure that requests from these servers are allowed through firewalls, etc.

**Note:** Vipps may change the IP addresses that we make callbacks from. To ensure that you are whitelisting the corrects IP addresses please use these hostnames.  


### URLs must be reachable

Please make sure that the callback URLs are valid:

* Vipps does _not_ support sending requests to all ports, so to be safe use common port numbers such as: 80, 443, 8080.
* Vipps does _not_ support callback URLs that return `HTTP 301 Redirect` or `HTTP 302 Permanently Moved`. The callback URLs _must_ be directly reachable.

Example: Regular Checkout Callback:

```json
{
  "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
  "orderId": "order123abc",
  "transactionInfo": {
    "amount": 20000,
    "status": "RESERVED",
    "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
    "transactionId": "5001420062"
  }
}
```


Example: Express Checkout Callback:

```json
{
  "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
  "orderId": "order123abc",
  "shippingDetails": {
    "address": {
      "addressLine1": "Dronning Eufemias gate 42",
      "addressLine2": "Att: Rune Garborg",
      "city": "Oslo",
      "country": "Norway",
      "postCode": "0191"
    },
    "shippingCost": 109.99,
    "shippingMethod": "By cannon"
  },
  "transactionInfo": {
    "amount": 20000,
    "status": "RESERVE",
    "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
    "transactionId": "5001420062"
  },
  "userDetails": {
    "bankIdVerified": "Y",
    "dateOfBirth": "12-3-1988",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "firstName": "Ada",
    "lastName": "Lovelace",
    "mobileNumber": "12345678",
    "ssn": "12345678901",
    "userId": "1234567"
  }
}
```

Example: Response body for `"isApp":false`

```json
{
    "orderId": "order123abc",
    "url": "https://api.vipps.no/deeplink/vippsgateway?token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3R <snip>"
}
```
Example: Response body for `"isApp":true`

```json
{
    "orderId": "order123abc",
    "url": "vipps://?token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXkiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIi <snip>"
}
```

The `url` is slightly simplified, but the format is correct.

The URL depends on whether the `initiate` request was provided the `isApp` parameter:
* For `true`, the URL is for an deeplink to the Vipps app.
* For `false` or not provided, the URL is for the Vipps "landing page".


### Callback statuses

| Callback | Response "Status" or "Operation"    |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Callback for *regular* checkout: [`[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST) | `RESERVED` - When user approved and payment is reserved. |
|   |  `SALE` - When user approved and payment type is Direct capture.  |
|   |  `RESERVE_FAILED` - Reserve failed because of no coverage, outdated card details or similar. |
|   |  `SALE_FAILED` - Direct capture failed because of no coverage, outdated card details or similar. |
|   |  `CANCELLED` - User rejected the payment. |
|   |  `REJECTED` - User didn't act on the payment. |
| Callback for *express* checkout: [`[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST)  | `RESERVE` - When user approved and payment is reserved. (It _is_ correct that this is different from `RESERVED` for regular checkout.)|
|    | `SALE` - When user approved and payment type is Direct capture.  |
|    | `CANCELLED` - User rejected the payment.  |
|    | `REJECTED` - User didn't act on the payment.  |

##### Callback endpoints

The calls are generated by taking a field from the payment initiation request from the merchant in
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST),
amnd then adding a suffix. See the "Endpoints required by Vipps" section in the [Swagger documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/).

| Endpoint	| Field | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [`POST:[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST) | callbackPrefix | Status update sent from Vipps |
| [`POST:[shippingDetailsPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}/shippingDetails`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/fetchShippingCostUsingPOST) | shippingDetailsPrefix | Request for getting shipping details. (Express checkout functionality, 10 second timeout) |
| [`DELETE:[consentRemovalPrefix]/v2/consents/{userId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/removeUserConsentUsingDELETE) | consentRemovalPrefix | User has removed consent for sharing details. (Express checkout functionality) |

### Using a phone

Both the deeplink URL, which causes the app-switch to Vipps, and the landing
page displayed in browsers, is valid for 5 minutes.

If the user does not act on the app-switch (such as not attempting to log into
Vipps) within 5 minutes, the payment times out.

After the app-switch to Vipps, the user has another 5 minutes to complete the
payment in Vipps.

This means that the user has a total of 10 minutes to complete the payment.

### Using a laptop/desktop

If the user is using a laptop/desktop device, and the user must confirm or
enter the phone number on the landing page within 5 minutes.
If the user does not do so, the payment times out.

After the user has clicked "OK" on the landing page, the user
has an additional 5 minutes to complete the payment in Vipps.

This means that the user has a total of 10 minutes to complete the payment.


## Express checkout API endpoints required on the merchant side

The below endpoints are provided by the _merchant_ and consumed by Vipps during express checkout payments.
These endpoints are included in the Swagger file for reference.

| Operation           | Description         | Endpoint          |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Get shipping details | Used to fetch shipping information | [`POST:/v2/payments/{orderId}/shippingDetails`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/fetchShippingCostUsingPOST)  |
| Transaction Update | A callback to the merchant for receiving post-payment information. | [`POST:/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST)  |
| Remove user consent | Used to inform merchant when the Vipps user removes consent to share information.  | [`DELETE:/v2/consents/{userId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/removeUserConsentUsingDELETE)  |

The following endpoints are to be implemented by merchants, in order for Vipps to make calls to them.
The documentation is included in the Swagger file for reference only - these endpoints are _not_ callable at Vipps.

#### Get shipping details

This API call allows Vipps to get the shipping cost and method based on the provided address and product details. This is only relevant for express checkout payments where Vipps needs to present shipping cost and method to the Vipps user. This service is to be implemented by merchants.

If `authToken` was used in the initiate payment request these requests will have a `Authorization` header. These headers will have the same value as the one provided in `authToken`.

API details: [`POST:[shippingDetailsPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}/shippingDetails`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/fetchShippingCostUsingPOST)

**Note:** We do not send requests to all ports so to be safe use common port numbers such as: 80, 443, 8080.

#### Example Request Shipping Details Callback
```json
{
    "addressId": 3960,
    "addressLine1": "Dronning Eufemias gate 42",
    "addressLine2": null,
    "country": "Norway",
    "city": "OSLO",
    "postCode": "0191",
    "addressType": "H",
}
```

#### Example Response for Shipping Details Callback

```json
{
    "addressId": 3960,
    "orderId": "123456abc",
    "shippingDetails": [
        {
            "isDefault": "N",
            "priority": 1,
            "shippingCost": 30.0,
            "shippingMethod": "Walking",
            "shippingMethodId": "123abc"
        },
        {
            "isDefault": "Y",
            "priority": 2,
            "shippingCost": 30.0,
            "shippingMethod": "Running",
            "shippingMethodId": "321abc"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Transaction update

A callback to the merchant for receiving post-payment information:
[`POST:/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST).

### Remove User Consent

This allows Vipps to send an end user's consent removal request to merchant.
This endpoint is required for express checkout. When receiving this request,
the merchant is obliged to handle the user details as per the GDPR guidelines.
The request path will include a `userId` that Vipps will have provided as
part of callback, and also made accessible through [`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET).

API details: [`DELETE:[consetRemovalPrefix]/v2/consents/{userId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Endpoints_required_by_Vipps_from_the_merchant/removeUserConsentUsingDELETE)

**Note:** We do not send requests to all ports so to be safe use common port numbers such as: 80, 443, 8080.


## Skip landing page

*Only available for whitelisted sale units.*

If the `skipLandingPage` property is set to `true` in the
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)
call, it will cause a push notification to be sent to the given phone number
immediately, without loading the landing page.

If the sale unit is not whitelisted, this property is ignored.

If you need to be whitelisted, instructions for this can be found in the
[FAQ](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-psp-api/blob/master/vipps-psp-api-faq.md#is-it-possible-to-skip-the-landing-page).


# Reserve

When the user confirms, the payment status changes to `RESERVE`.
The respective amount will be reserved for future capturing.

## The Vipps landing page

When a user has selected Vipps for payment, the Vipps landing page
detects whether user is using a desktop browser or a mobile browser:

* In a mobile browser, the landing page detects if the Vipps app is installed,
  and automatically switches to the Vipps app if it is.
* In a desktop browser, the landing page prompts the user for the phone number (the number may also be pre-filled).
  The user enters or confirms the phone number. Then on their phone, the user gets a push notification and the Vipps app then prompts for confirmation.

The Vipps landing page is mandatory, and provides a consistent and recognizable user experience,
that helps guide the user through the payment flow.
In this way Vipps takes responsibility for helping the user from the browser to the app,
and to complete the payment in a familiar way.

The user's phone number can be set in the payment initiation call:
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST).

The user's phone number is remembered by the user's browser,
eliminating the need for re-typing it on subsequent purchases.

See also: [Skip landing page](#skip-landing-page).


### Example Get payment details

[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/order123abc/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)

```json
{
    "orderId": "order123abc",
    "transactionSummary": {
        "capturedAmount": 0,
        "remainingAmountToCapture": 20000,
        "refundedAmount": 0,
        "remainingAmountToRefund": 0
    },
    "transactionLogHistory": [
        {
            "amount": 20000,
            "transactionText": "One pair of Vipps socks",
            "transactionId": "5001420062",
            "timeStamp": "2018-11-14T15:21:22.126Z",
            "operation": "RESERVE",
            "requestId": "",
            "operationSuccess": true
        },
        {
            "amount": 20000,
            "transactionText": "One pair of Vipps socks",
            "transactionId": "5001420062",
            "timeStamp": "2018-11-14T15:21:04.697Z",
            "operation": "INITIATE",
            "requestId": "",
            "operationSuccess": true
        }
    ]
}
```

**Please note:** The `transactionSummary` will not be part of the response if
the user not reacted to the Vipps landing page or app-switch.


# Capture


## Reserve capture

_Reserve capture_ is the normal flow.

When then end user approves an initiated payment it will be reserved until you capture it. When the order is reserved
the amount is marked as reserved by the bank, but not transferred.

## Direct capture

When _direct capture_ is activated, all payment reservations will instantly be captured.

When doing _direct capture_ Vipps is responsible for the customer receiving the purchased product.
Because of this, _direct capture_ requires additional compliance checks, and the following
requirements apply:
* The merchant must have an annual revenue of more than 10 million NOK
* The merchant must have a Key Account Manager (KAM) in Vipps
* The merchant must have a partner that is responsible for the Vipps integration

To request _direct capture_, please contact your KAM.

Capture payment allows the merchant to capture the reserved amount.
The API allows for both a _full amount capture_ and a _partial amount capture_.

The amount to capture cannot be higher than the reserved amount. According to
Norwegian regulations, capture can not be done before the goods have been shipped.
The transaction text is mandatory, and is displayed to end user in Vipps.

## Partial capture

Partial capture may be used if not the entire order is shipped or for other
reasons. Partial capture may be called as many times as required as long as
there is a remaining reserved amount to capture.

If one or more partial captures have been made, the remaining amount
(if there is one) will be automatically refunded after a few days.
See the FAQ for
[details](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-faq.md#for-how-long-is-an-initiated-payment-reserved).
It is not possible to refund the remaining amount (since it has not been captured),
and it is not possible to cancel the reservation, since some of it has been captured.

There is only a need to specify the `amount` when doing a partial capture.
To perform capture of the entire amount `amount` can be set to `null` or `0`


## Recurring eCommerce payments

Recurring eCommerce is its own seperate product and can be found descriped in details in
our [Recurring Repo.](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api)


# Cancel

Reservations can be cancelled, and the payment flow aborted, under certain circumstances:

* When the user cancels (rejects) the initiated payment in the Vipps app.
* Timeouts: If the user does not confirm, etc.

Partially captured reservations can not be cancelled.

After cancellation, the order gets a new status:
* If an order is cancelled by the merchant, it gets the status `VOID`.
* If an order is cancelled by the user, it gets the status `CANCEL`.

    }
}
```



# Refund

The merchant can initiate a refund of the captured amount.
The refund can be a partial or full.

Partial refunds are done by specifying an `amount` which is lower than the captured amount.
The refunded amount cannot be larger than the captured amount.

In a capture request the merchant may also use the `X-Request-Id`header. This header is an idempotency header ensuring that if the merchant retries a request with the same `X-Request-Id` the retried request will not make additional changes.

## Polling guidelines

General guidelines for When to start polling with
[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET):
1. Start after 5 seconds.
2. Check every 2 seconds.

These are reasonable values, but different merchants have different use cases,
and values should be adapted to the specific case.
See [Timeouts](#timeouts) for details about timeouts.

```json
"transactionSummary": {
    "capturedAmount": 20000,
    "remainingAmountToCapture": 0,
    "refundedAmount": 0,
    "remainingAmountToRefund": 0
}
```

In this truncated example, it shows that a partial capture of 100.00 NOK, of
the total reserved amount of 200.00 NOK, has been captured:

```json
"transactionsummary": {
    "capturedAmount": 10000,
    "remainingAmountToCapture": 10000,
    "refundedAmount": 0,
    "remainingAmountToRefund": 0
}
```

**Please note:** The `transactionSummary` will not be part of the response if
the user not reacted to the Vipps landing page or app-switch.

# Idempotency

In a capture request the merchant may also use the `X-Request-Id`header.
This header is an idempotency header ensuring that if the merchant retries
a request with the same `X-Request-Id` the retried request will not make
additional changes.

**Request**

[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments/order123abc/capture`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/capturePaymentUsingPOST)

## Exception handling

Every system, especially those that includes complex integrations and/or
participation of many users, is prone to unexpected conditions. Below section
explains how Vipps handles different exception and error situations in detail.

### Connection timeout

Defining a socket timeout period is the common measure to protect server
resources and is expected. However, the time needed to fulfill a service requests
depends on several systems, which impose longer timeout period than usually
required.

We recommend setting no less than 1 second socket connection timeout
and 5 seconds socket read timeout while communicating with Vipps.

A good practice is, if/when the socket read timeout occurs, to call
[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)
and check status of last transaction in transaction history prior
to executing the service call again.

### Callback aborted/interrupted

If the communication is broken during payment process for some reason, and
Vipps is not able to execute callback, then callback will not be retried.

In other words, if the merchant doesn’t receive any confirmation on payment
request call within callback timeframe, merchant should call
[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)
to get the response of payment request.

### PSP connection issues

In a case when Vipps experiences communication problems with PSP, service call
will respond with 402 HTTP Error. Merchant should make a call to
[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)
to check if the transaction request is processed before making service
call (with same idempotency key) again.


# App integration

Merchants may implement deep-linking, to trigger the Vipps app (we refer to this as "app-switch" here).

This may be done in two ways:

1. From a mobile or desktop browser
2. From an iOS or Android native app

After the user has finished (or cancelled) the payment in the Vipps app, the user is returned back to the browser or native app that started the payment flow (via a the fallback URL provided by the merchant when the order is created). The merchant app or website should then query the ecom API for the updated state of the payment operation.

*NOTE:* When the user arrives back in the merchant app or website, we strongly recommend that you perform a call to the ecom api to check the state of the transaction.
While some of the state of the ecom operation *can* be derived from things like wether or not user returned successfully from the native app, the most reliable
approach to know the state of the payment flow is always to query the ecom API once you arrive back in the merchant app/website.

The sections below explain in more detail how to integrate for browsers and apps.

## App-switch between mobile or desktop browsers and the Vipps app

For mobile and desktop browsers, integration is handled by Vipps using the Vipps landing page.

The merchant needs to provide a valid `fallBack` URL.
When Vipps has completed the operation, the `fallBack` URL will be opened in the browser.
To maintain the session, the merchant can pass along a session identifier in the `fallBack` URL.

### App-switch on iOS

1. The Vipps app on iOS requires a URL scheme in order to support app-switch.
2. The merchant need to pass the URL Scheme of app into `fallBack` URL the in Vipps backend API.
3. The merchant will open the URL received from Vipps backend API.
4. Once the operation in the Vipps app is completed, Vipps will open the URL specified in `fallBack` URL.
5. The merchant app should query the ecom API for updated status on the payment once user returns from the Vipps app.

#### Switch from merchant app to the Vipps app

Below is sample code to open iOS Vipps application with `deeplinkURL`.

```java
NSString *url = deeplinkURL; // Use the deeplinkURL provided in the API response
if ([[UIApplication sharedApplication] canOpenURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]]) {
  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]]; }
else {
  // No Vipps app installed: Open app store page.
  // Once user installs Vipps, calling app needs to initiate deeplinking again in order to get the callback
  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString: @"https://itunes.apple.com/no/app/Vipps-by-dnb/id984380185"]];
}
```

Example of a `deeplinkURL`:

`vipps://?token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXkiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.ey <snip>`

**Please note:** If you have both the official Vipps app from App Store _and_ the test Vipps app from TestFlight installed,
the app switch may open either one. There is no way to open one of them specifically, as
the URL scheme is the same for both. We recommend to only have one of the apps installed on the device.

#### Redirect back to the merchant app from Vipps app

Once the operation in the Vipps app is completed, the Vipps app will open the fallback URL.
For app-to-app integration, merchant app needs to be registered for a URL scheme
and pass the URL scheme in `fallBack` URL in the Vipps backend API.
The Vipps mobile application will use the URL to launch the merchant application.

For example, if your `fallBack` URL is `merchantApp://result?myAppData`, Vipps
will append the status like: `merchantApp://result?myAppData&status=301`.

##### Registering a 3rd party app with URL scheme and handling custom URL calls

See the official Apple documentation:
[Defining a Custom URL Scheme for Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app)

### App-switch on Android

Vipps is launched with a standard intent, using the url returned from the eCom
API when the payment is created ("url": "vipps://?token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXki..")

#### Switching from merchant app to the Vipps app

Example of how to open the Vipps app:

```java
try {
  PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();
  PackageInfo info = pm.getPackageInfo( , PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES);
  if(versionCompare(info.versionName,   ) >= 0) {
    String uri = deeplinkURL; // Use deeplink url provided in ecom API response
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    intent.setData(Uri.parse(uri));
    startActivityForResult(intent,requestCode);
  } else {
    // Notify user to download the latest version of Vipps application.
  }
} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
  // No Vipps app! Open play store page.
  String url = " https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.dnb.vipps";
  Intent storeIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
  storeIntent.setData(Uri.parse(url));
  startActivity(storeIntent);
}
```


#### Switching back to the merchant app from Vipps app

Once the user has paid (or cancelled), the Vipps app supports two ways to return to the merchant native app:

  1: Let the vipps app deeplink back into the merchant app using their url scheme (eg. merchantapp://). This is the default/suggested approach.

  2: Just close the Vipps app, fall back to the merchant app, pick up the thread again there in onActivityResult().

In both cases, the merchant app should query the ecom API for updated status on the payment once user returns from the Vipps app.

##### Return back to merchant app by actively deeplinking into it from Vipps

With this approach, the merchant app has to have its own URL scheme registered so the Vipps app can actively open the merchant app again after payment/cancellation.

In the example below, `MainActivity` is the receiving activity and the Vipps app opens it once the payment is done.

To receive a call back from the Vipps application to an activity, a filter has to be set for that activity. In the merchant app, set a filter in the Manifest file:

```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity" android:label="@string/app_name" android:launchMode="singleInstance">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="sampleApps" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Note: The scheme should be same specified in `fallBack` URL sent to the ecom api when the payment is created.

The Vipps application will send the result to the merchant app by
starting a new activity with the `fallBack` URL as a URL parameter in the intent.

The merchant app can make their receiving activity a `singleInstance`
to handle the response in same activity.

The receiving MainActivity has to override the `onNewIntent` method to handle
result send by the Vipps app:

```java
@Override
protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
      // Call the eCom api, check the status of the eCom payment
}
```

##### Redirect back to merchant app by simply closing the Vipps app

With this approach, the merchant app does not have to register/handle deeplink urls.

In order to use this approach, when creating the payment in the merchant has to pass fallback attribute like this:

```"fallBack": "INTENT" ```

(and *only* "INTENT"", no parameters etc.)

This will cause the Vipps app to simply close after a successful or canceled ecom payment, and fall back to the calling merchant app.

The merchant app activity that resumes again (after the Vipps app closes) has to override onActivityResult method to pick up the thread again here. Example:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    // Call the eCom api, check the status of the eCom payment
}
```
